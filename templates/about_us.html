      <p>
        This System is built as the end of course final year project of two students 
        from the University of Ghana; Computer Science Department. 
        Dr. Ferdinand Katsriku being the project supervisor, supervised the design and implementation
        of this project. The collaborators focused on making this management system for the UGEL Halls 
        due to its relatively, huge data they work on each day. Nevertheless, it 
        can surely be customized for any other hall or hostel on campus.
        An objective was making this system a much easier one to use and less complicated, 
        while simultaneously increasing workflow of users in the UGEL halls.
        With this Hall Management System, users are guaranteed to have an easier
        time managing the large students count in these halls.
